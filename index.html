            <p>The first data type is a quantitative attribute representing the individual areas of the pie chart. 
                This is a mark represented by the individual areas. The second data type is a quantitative attribute representing 
                the size of the pie chart, this is a channel represented by the size of the actual chart. The third and fourth 
                attributes are quantitative attributes, that are channels, that are the position of the pie chart on the graph.</p>

        <div class="flex-item item-2">
            <img src="img/bump_chart.png">
            <p>One data type is categorical, determining the year for the data point, this is a channel representing the 
                position on the chart. The second data type is categorical determining the starting rank of the point, in this 
                graph 1-5 or A-E, this is a channel represented by vertical position as well as color. The next data type is
                 categorical attribute and is a mark representing the rank over time. The next attribute is a link to represent 
                 the node changing over time which is a mark. </p>

        <div class="flex-item item-3">
            <img src="img/mind_map.png" >
            <p>One data type is categorical, determining the content of the individual bubbles, this is represented by a channel 
                as the different color of the node determines which type of node it is, whether it is a theme, category, or idea.
                 The next type is a link that represents the link between different nodes in the map. This is a line and therefore
                  a mark.</p>

        <div class="flex-item item-4">
            <img src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png">
            <p>A data type is the category along the x axis representing the “main” category of the data. The next data type is
                 a category of the different subcategories in each bar of the bar chart. The third data type is quantitative 
                 attribute along the y axis representing the count or another value of the subcategories as well as the category 
                 as a whole. One channel is the position on the x axis representing the main categories A-D. The next channel 
                 is the different colors of the main bars to represent the subcategories. The next channel is the height of the 
                 individual bars as well as the subcategories of the bar.  </p>
